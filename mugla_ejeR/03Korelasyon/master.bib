Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of gender on the organizational commitment of teachers. In this respect, the levels of organizational commitment were also investigated with organizational commitment. Fifteen master and doctorate theses done between 2005-2009 were analyzed using meta analysis. At the end of the research study, the mean effect size was calculated as -0,07. It means that the effect of gender on the organizational commitment is on the favor of males. Particularly, it was found that the effect of gender is in the favor of males at the levels of identification and internalization. Male teachers can adopt the norms and values of the organization easier than females. On the other hand, female teachers have a tendency of organizational commitment so as to carry on their acquisition.},

Abstract = {In this study, the efficiency of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) was compared with traditional methods. The effect size (ES) of PBL on academic achievement was calculated by using a meta-analytic method defined as drawing a general conclusion by analysing the data from a range of independent studies of similar subjects. Thus, 26 experimental studies were selected, which comply with the inclusion criteria determined with the help of research carried out between 2006 and 2013. The effect size of PBL on academic achievement was calculated as 1.302. According to Thalheimer and Cook's (2002) detailed level calculation, this value has a very large effect. The results of meta-analysis demonstrate that compared to traditional instruction methods, PBL has a positive effect on academic achievement. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {This research aimed to make a systematic review of the experimental studies related to Jigsaw technique, one of cooperative learning techniques, conducted in the years of 2005-2012 in Turkey and to determine the effect of Jigsaw technique on students' academic achievements, retention and attitudes. In this context it was tried to answer the question of "What's the effect of Jigsaw technique on students' academic success?". Among 37 studies (25 articles, 12 theses) searched, 11 ones (6 articles, 5 dissertation) in which pretest-posttest method was applied and comparisons between groups were made were selected in particular. Those studies incorporated into meta-analysis and including academic achievement scores were analyzed with random effects model and it was identified that the calculated value had large effect size (ES = 1.1971) according to Cohen's (1992) classification.

The material is organized into five units: (1) introduction to measurement theory; (2) reliability; (3) validity; (4) item analysis in test development; and (5) test scoring and interpretation. The first unit provides background information for readers with little formal education in measurement or statistics. Each of the subsequent units presents classical theory in the initial chapters, followed by more recent developments in later chapters, with a discussion of how these procedures relate to the traditional concepts. In effect, an introduction to classical test theory can be obtained from Chapters 1 through 7 and chapters 10 14, 17, and 19, while an introduction to recent topics in psychometrics can be derived from Chapters 8, 9, 15, 16, 18, and 20. Computational exercises and questions follow each chapter to illustrate applications of the theoretical concepts presented in the accompanying chapter. Appendix A illustrates probabilities and Y ordinates associated with a given z-score under the standard normal curve, and Appendix B is the key to the exercises. (SLD)},

"Using an intuitive, informal style, the authors adopt a "bottom-up" approach - a simpler, less abstract discussion of analysis of variance is presented prior to developing the more general model. A concern for alternatives to standard analyses allows for the integration of non-parametric techniques into relevant design chapter, rather than in a single, isolated chapter. This organization allows for the comparison of the pros and cons of alternative procedures within the research context to which they apply." "Basic concepts such as sampling distribution, expected mean squares, design efficiency, and statistical models are emphasized throughout. This approach provides a stronger conceptual foundation in order to help readers generalize the concepts to new situations they will encounter in their research and to better understand the advice of statistical consultants and the content of article using statistical methodology."--BOOK JACKET.},

abstract={Keeping the uniquely humorous and self-deprecating style that has made students across the world fall in love with Andy Field's books, Discovering Statistics Using R takes students on a journey of statistical discovery using R, a free, flexible and dynamically changing software tool for data analysis that is becoming increasingly popular across the social and behavioural sciences throughout the world. The journey begins by explaining basic statistical and research concepts before a guided tour of the R software environment. Next you discover the importance of exploring and graphing data, before moving onto statistical tests that are the foundations of the rest of the book (for example correlation and regression). You will then stride confidently into intermediate level analyses such as ANOVA, before ending your journey with advanced techniques such as MANOVA and multilevel models. Although there is enough theory to help you gain the necessary conceptual understanding of what you're doing, the emphasis is on applying what you learn to playful and real-world examples that should make the experience more fun than you might expect. Like its sister textbooks, Discovering Statistics Using R is written in an irreverent style and follows the same ground-breaking structure and pedagogical approach. The core material is augmented by a cast of characters to help the reader on their way, together with hundreds of examples, self-assessment tests to consolidate knowledge, and additional website material for those wanting to learn more at: Instructor Site.

abstract={A new univariate sampling approach for bootstrapping correlation coefficients is proposed and evaluated. Bootstrapping correlations to define confidence intervals or to test hypotheses has previously relied on repeated bivariate sampling of observed (x,y) values to create an empirical sampling distribution. Bivariate sampling matches the logic of confidence interval construction, but hypothesis testing logic suggests that x and y should be sampled independently. This study uses Monte Carlo methods to compare the univariate bootstrap with 3 bivariate bootstrap procedures and with the traditional parametric procedure, using various sample sizes, population correlations, and population distributions. Results suggest that the univariate bootstrap is superior to other bootstrap procedures in many hypothesis testing settings, and even improves on parametric hypothesis testing in certain cases.
